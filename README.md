# linked_list
Short description: 
A short project that implements a doubly-linked list in order to expand my knowledge of GitHub source control.

Long description: 
This is my first attempt at utilizing GitHub as a source control and code database source.  I chose to implement a doubly-linked list here in order to give me a simple, multi-file project, so that I can experiment with GitHub more than I already have.

Concept explanation:
A doubly-linked list utilizes nodes containing 2 pointers and a stored value.  One pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the other points to the next node.  These pointers will be NULL if they are contained in a node that is at the head and/or tail of the list.  The stored value will initially be an integer, through I may expand on this project to make my implementation a template.

Motivation for project:
I wanted to have a simple project in order to learn how to use GitHub more effectively.
